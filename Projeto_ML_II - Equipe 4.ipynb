    "A PyCoders Ltda., cada vez mais especializada no mundo da Inteligência Artificial e Ciência de Dados, foi procurada por uma fintech para desenvolver um projeto de concessão de crédito para imóveis. Nesse projeto, espera-se a criação de valor que discrimine ao máximo os bons pagadores dos maus pagadores. Para isso, foi disponibilizada uma base de dados com milhares de casos de empréstimos do passado com diversas características dos clientes. Devem ser entregues um modelo. Por questões contratuais, o pagamento será realizado baseado no desempenho (ROC AUC) do modelo ao longo do tempo."

O conjunto de dados está dividido em treino e teste, todos no formato csv. Toda a modelagem, validação e avaliação deve ser feita em cima do conjunto de treino, subdividindo tal base como a squad achar melhor. Existe também os das variáveis explicativas, para ajudar no desenvolvimento do projeto. Serão necessários diversos cruzamentos e vocês estão livres para usar os dados da maneira que acharem mais conveniente.\n",
